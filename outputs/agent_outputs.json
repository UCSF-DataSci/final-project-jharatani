    "query": "patient with heart attack symptoms and high WBC",
    "response": "Based on the semantic search results, I found two potential notes that mention heart attack symptoms and high WBC levels.\n\nThe first note is related to a patient with coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. The second note mentions pulmonic valve replacement, left atrial fibrillation, myotonia, potassium-aggravated, peripheral arterial disease, aortic stenosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and piperacillin-tazobactam and levofloxacin for a CTCAE grade 4 arthritis.\n\nHowever, the most relevant note to both symptoms is:\n\n**C1560000**\n\nThis note mentions chest x-ray showing a right upper lobe opacity, which could be indicative of a heart attack. It also mentions that the patient was started on piperacillin-tazobactam and levofloxacin for a CTCAE grade 4 arthritis.\n\nThe triage level is **URGENT** due to the presence of high WBC levels, which may indicate an infection or inflammation.\n\nRed flags:\n\n* High WBC levels\n* Chest x-ray showing a right upper lobe opacity\n\nNext steps:\n1. Further evaluation and testing for infections or inflammatory conditions.\n2. Consider administering antibiotics or other treatments as needed.\n3. Monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment as necessary.\n\nDisclaimer: This is an educational example only. If you are a medical professional, please consult with a qualified healthcare expert before providing any treatment or guidance."
