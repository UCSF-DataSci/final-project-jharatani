Query: patient with heart attack symptoms and high WBC
Response:
Based on the semantic search results, I found two potential notes that mention heart attack symptoms and high WBC levels.

The first note is related to a patient with coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. The second note mentions pulmonic valve replacement, left atrial fibrillation, myotonia, potassium-aggravated, peripheral arterial disease, aortic stenosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and piperacillin-tazobactam and levofloxacin for a CTCAE grade 4 arthritis.

However, the most relevant note to both symptoms is:

**C1560000**

This note mentions chest x-ray showing a right upper lobe opacity, which could be indicative of a heart attack. It also mentions that the patient was started on piperacillin-tazobactam and levofloxacin for a CTCAE grade 4 arthritis.

The triage level is **URGENT** due to the presence of high WBC levels, which may indicate an infection or inflammation.

Red flags:

* High WBC levels
* Chest x-ray showing a right upper lobe opacity

Next steps:
1. Further evaluation and testing for infections or inflammatory conditions.
2. Consider administering antibiotics or other treatments as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment as necessary.
