Effectively asking if a general LLM can interpret text produced/generated by another LLM. Allows us to see model-to-model transfer of information, with complex terminologies a lot can get lost in translation. 

We use a pretrained large language model to perform structured information extraction on a synthetic biomedical corpus originally generated by a fine-tuned LLaMA-2 model. No additional model training or fine-tuning was performed; all results are obtained via prompt-based inference.

**Pt. 1**

The model outputs standardized JSON fields (diagnosis, medications, lab values, confidence), producing a machine-readable dataset for downstream semantic search.


**Pt. 2**

 Now we have merged our json file output diagnoses and performed a semantics search to further assess the data.
